# This script creates one image with three plots, each of them containing 
# visually pleasing representation of a selected slice in one of the axes
# (the one with the highest bone content)
#
# We suggest that you use typer to implement the script.

# 1) Start with a script that reads `data/data.nc` into data and prints some info about it.

# 2) Change the input path into an argument of the script.

# 3) Include the functions to find the slice and create the plots
#    Note: You will not see the plots unless you explcitly request it.

# 4) Add an argument `output_path` to which you write the created figure.

# 5) Add arguments to enable setting vmax, vmin and cmap.

# 6) Optional: Using levels, use a different colour for each tissue type
#    instead of a gradient. See https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/plotting.html#discrete-colormaps
