# Computed tomography exercise(s)

## Preparation

Make sure you have a proper Python virtual environment ready (no need to create a new one):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Exercise 1 - exploration notebook

You are presented with a C(omputed) T(omography) 3D model of a person's head.
Open the notebook `exercise.ipynb` to explore this data set.

## Exercise 2 - script 

Use the fragments of code you created in exercise 1 and create a command-line script
that will automate the notebook process with a few arguments / options. See `slicer.py`
for the description and code template.
